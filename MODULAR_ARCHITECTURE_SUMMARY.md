- ✅ **Commit-reveal voting** - Prevents vote manipulation
- ✅ **Arbitrator staking** - 1000+ RN token requirement
- ✅ **Loser pays** - Bond slashing for frivolous disputes
- ✅ **Time-bounded resolution** - 5-day voting + 2-day reveal windows

## 🔒 **Privacy & Security Features**

### **Zero PII On-Chain**
- ✅ All personal data stays off-chain
- ✅ Subject commits use cryptographic hashing
- ✅ Evidence stored on IPFS/Arweave with CID references
- ✅ Only public business information in registry

### **Economic Security**
- ✅ Staking requirements aligned with risk levels
- ✅ Slashing mechanisms for poor performance
- ✅ Challenge bonds to prevent spam disputes
- ✅ Reputation systems for long-term accountability

### **Governance & Access Control**
- ✅ Role-based permissions using OpenZeppelin AccessControl
- ✅ Pausable contracts for emergency stops
- ✅ Upgradeability considerations for future improvements
- ✅ Multi-signature support for administrative functions

## 📈 **Token Economics (Based on Intel Techniques Methodology)**

### **Reward Structure:**
- **Broker Submission**: 100 RN tokens
- **Removal Processing**: 50 RN tokens (base) + weight multiplier
- **High-Impact Multiplier**: 3x for critical brokers
- **Verification Reward**: 5 RN tokens per verification
- **Arbitration Reward**: 10 RN tokens for correct decisions

### **Staking Requirements:**
- **User Stake**: 10 RN (skin in the game)
- **Worker Stake**: 100 RN (basic commitment)
- **Processor Stake**: 1,000 RN (professional level)
- **Verifier Stake**: 500 RN (review responsibility)
- **Arbitrator Stake**: 1,000 RN (dispute resolution)

## 🛡️ **Anti-Fraud Mechanisms**

### **Slashing Conditions:**
- **Processors**: 10% for non-performance or fake completions
- **Verifiers**: 20% for frivolous approvals during disputes
- **Arbitrators**: Variable based on incorrect decisions

### **Dispute Resolution:**
- **7-day dispute window** after verification
- **Commit-reveal voting** prevents coordination attacks
- **Multiple arbitrators** required for valid decisions
- **Bond requirements** prevent spam disputes
