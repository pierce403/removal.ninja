# ðŸ¥· removal.ninja

A decentralized data broker removal tool with token incentives. Help protect privacy while earning rewards through our blockchain-based ecosystem.

## Overview

removal.ninja is a decentralized platform that incentivizes:
- **Data Broker Discovery**: Users earn 100 RN tokens for submitting new data brokers
- **Removal Processing**: Trusted processors earn 50 RN tokens for each completed removal
- **User Privacy Protection**: Users stake tokens to get comprehensive data removal services

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Data Broker Submission System
- Community-driven database of data brokers
- Token rewards for verified submissions
- Detailed removal instructions

### ðŸ”’ Staking-Based Removal List
- Users stake RN tokens to access removal services
- Choose trusted processors for handling sensitive data
- Decentralized processor selection

### âš¡ Trusted Processor Network
- Processors stake tokens and can be slashed for poor performance
- Earn rewards for processing removal requests
- Build reputation through successful completions

### ðŸª™ Token Economics
- ERC-20 RN (RemovalNinja) token
- Staking mechanisms with slashing protection
- Automated reward distribution
