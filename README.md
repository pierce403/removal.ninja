# ü•∑ removal.ninja

A decentralized data broker removal protocol with token incentives and zkEmail verification. Help protect privacy while earning rewards through our blockchain-based ecosystem.

## Overview

removal.ninja is a decentralized platform that creates a comprehensive data broker removal ecosystem through:
- **Data Broker Discovery**: Community-sourced database of data brokers with verified opt-out flows
- **Trusted Processor Network**: Vetted entities that handle sensitive removal requests with staked collateral
- **User-Selected Privacy**: Users choose which processors they trust with their personal information
- **Incentivized Participation**: Token rewards for contributing to the privacy protection ecosystem
- **Cryptographic Verification**: zkEmail proofs for verified removal completion

## Protocol Design

### üîÑ Removal Flow Architecture

**1. Data Broker Registry**
- Community members discover and submit new data brokers with their opt-out procedures
- Each submission includes website, removal instructions, and email verification endpoints
- Verified submissions earn contributors 100 RN tokens

**2. Trusted Processor Network**
- Processors stake significant collateral (1,000+ RN tokens) that can be slashed for poor performance
- Users select which processors they trust with their sensitive personal information
- Creates a competitive marketplace of privacy service providers

**3. User Privacy Journey**
- Users stake tokens (minimum 10 RN) to join the removal list
- During onboarding, users select their preferred trusted processors
- Users never need to share personal information on-chain
- Sensitive data is only shared with user-selected processors off-chain

**4. zkEmail Verification**
- Removal requests typically end with email confirmations from data brokers
- Processors use zkEmail proofs to cryptographically verify removal completions
- Provides trustless verification without revealing email contents
- Ensures processors are paid only for verified successful removals

**5. Incentive Alignment**
- Data broker submissions: **100 RN tokens**
- Successful removal processing: **50 RN tokens per removal**
- Processor slashing for non-performance protects user interests
- Token staking ensures skin-in-the-game for all participants
